# Express Navbar Assignment

This project is for CSC 317. Itâ€™s a Node/Express web app with three routes:
- `/climate-crisis`
- `/typesetting`
- `/four-algorithms`

Each route links to a different assignment repo. The homepage uses Flexbox for the navbar layout.

In order for the code to work:

1. install node.js

2. download both the index.html and server.js

3. to run the code, type "node server.js" and it will start the server and leave a link named, http://localhost:3000
